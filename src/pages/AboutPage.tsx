            <p>
              LifePath Coaching was founded with a simple belief: that understanding yourself is the 
              first step to living your best life. Our founders, experienced psychologists and certified 
              coaches, recognized the gap between academic personality research and practical self-discovery tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              We created a platform that bridges this gap, offering scientifically validated assessments 
              in an accessible, user-friendly format. Our goal is to democratize personal development, 
              making powerful psychological insights available to everyone, regardless of their background 
              or experience with personality psychology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we've helped thousands of individuals and organizations gain deeper self-awareness, 
              improve their relationships, and achieve their personal and professional goals through 
              our comprehensive assessment platform and personalized coaching services.
